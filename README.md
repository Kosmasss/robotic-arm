                                                       ROBOTIC-ARM




This is a realy simple 2 axis robotic arm with 3 degrees of freedom tha uses three 9gram servos and an arduino to move.A pcb powers all three servos and arduino  by using a 5V step-up power regulator.The software writen 
in Arduino IDE using only 2 libraries is very simple and customizable for future updates.An analog joystick and a button on the pcb controls the robotic arm ,if button is in the orginal state the first and second degree of freedom are controled by the joystick 
when the button is hold and pressed the joystick controls the third degre of freedom.
