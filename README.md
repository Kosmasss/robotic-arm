                                                       ROBOTIC-ARM




This is a realy simple 2 axis robotic arm with 3 degrees of freedom tha uses three 9gram servos and an arduino to move.A pcb powers all three servos and arduino .The software writen 
in Arduino IDE using only 2 libraries is very simple and customizable for future updates.An analog joystick and a button on the pcb controls the robotic arm ,if button is in the orginal state the first and second degree of freedom are controled by the joystick 
when the button is hold and pressed the joystick controls the third degre of freedom.

Assemble:

1) The Pcb has two version,the original and simplified.The main defference between them is that the simplifeid version uses the 5v pin of the arduino to power all the components instead of of the 5V step-up regulator and a screw terminal (original version).Also for lower cost both versions can be build using a breadboard and some jumper wires.

2) The software is flashed using Arduino IDE and PLATFORM.IO.

3) The Arm assembly process includes the three servos ,12 bolts and the 3Dprinted parts (arm,sevohorn).When building try to follow the CAD files.
   NOTE: To open and print the parts you need to have a CAD software (fusion 360 for example)
