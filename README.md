                                                       ROBOTIC-ARM




This is a realy simple 2 axis robotic arm with 3 degrees of freedom tha uses three 9gram servos and an arduino to move.A pcb powers all three servos and arduino  by using a 5V step-up power regulator.The software writen 
in Arduino IDE using only 2 libraries is very simple and customizable for future updates.An analog joystick and a button on the pcb controls the robotic arm , with a one click of the button the 
joystick controls the first and second degree of freedom and with a douple-tap the joystick controls the third degree of freedom.
